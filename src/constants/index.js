      'Double-glazed uPVC windows are a type of window commonly used in residential and commercial buildings. They consist of two panes of glass that are separated by a sealed space, typically filled with air or an insulating gas, such as argon or krypton. The term "uPVC" stands for unplasticized polyvinyl chloride, which is a type of rigid, durable plastic used for the window frames.',

      "Here are some key features and benefits of double-glazed uPVC windows:",
    pointOne:
      "1.  Energy Efficiency: The double glazing and the insulating space between the glass panes help to reduce heat transfer, making the windows more energy-efficient. This can result in lower heating and cooling costs for a building.",
    pointTwo:
      "2.  Sound Insulation: Double-glazed uPVC windows provide better sound insulation compared to single-glazed windows, helping to reduce outside noise and create a quieter indoor environment.",
    pointThree:
      "3.  Enhanced Security: uPVC frames are known for their durability and resistance to weathering and rot. They also come with multi-point locking systems, enhancing the security of the windows.",
    pointFour:
      "4.  Low Maintenance: uPVC windows are relatively low-maintenance and do not require painting. They are resistant to moisture, so they won't rot or corrode.",
